# CS361-400 Software Engineering I Final Project  

A collaborative project based on another classmate’s concept, used as a means to illustrate the _client / agency_ relationship. The gist of the project was a **_Kickstarter for Orphan Diseases_**. The course focused on the capture of detailed requirements associated with building said concept and the obvious overhead of intra-team and _client_ coordination. The course ultimately culminated in the development of this prototype (limited to a prototype primarily due to the concept’s huge scope in relation to the allotted time).

I was extremely fortunate to have been placed within a strong group.
